The Sphinx has riddles and is mysterious, like this homework.

Bullet list of issues:

- I lost Administrator rights on my laptop.
- This *fact* makes installing python and sphinx **quite hard**.
- I think I'm doing this correctly, but not sure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. I tried to install Chocolatey and was rudely denied.
2. Powershell gave me no ``python --version``
3. I have no python. I'm sad.

O'Reilly has a Japanese book about Sphinx.
------------------------------------------
In honor of that fact, here is a laptop Haiku:

| Bought a new laptop,
| now I'm torn with old laptop,
| or use new laptop!

+----------+----------+
| Old      |   New    |
+==========+==========+
| Easy     |  Hard    |
+----------+----------+
| Quick    +  Looong  +
+----------+----------+
| Can't    |  Decide  |
+----------+----------+
