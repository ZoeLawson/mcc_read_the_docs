The four stages are egg, larva, pupa, and adult. 

The Egg Stage
=============

All butterflies star as an egg. The female butterfly usually lays her egg on a leaf.

Butterfly eggs can be very small. 

The Larva Stage
===============

Once the egg hatches, a caterpillar will crawl out of the egg and eat the leaf.

The butterfly will continue to eat and eat and eat.  

The Pupa Stage
