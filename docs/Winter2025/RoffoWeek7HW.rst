Roffo HW 7: Use THIS file. I wish we could see the Rendering. I can see some of it, italics and bold; 
Save this text file as .rst.

This is the sphinx site that we can look up how to write the code for .rst:
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
4.3.2025 -- From the website above, I learned about Sphinx and reStructured Text:
Roffo's Minimal HW Requirements, to start us off:

reStructuredTextÂ¶   TITLE, so I will "double-underline" it using equal signs. OK. 
=======================
ReStructured Text Title
=======================
Here is a paragraph. ReStructuredText (reST) is the default plaintext markup language used by both Docutils and Sphinx. 
Docutils provides the basic reStructuredText syntax, while Sphinx extends this to support additional functionality.
For now, I'll just use Docutils because time is short and I'm trying to complete all the homeworks. Hopefully, I can come back and try Sphinx.

You must include a blank line between paragraphs. Ok. Here is the second paragraph and a hyperlink target:
According to the hyperlink reference docutils_, .. _Docutils: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html#hyperlink-targets, 
*One asterisk before and after a string is the emphasis of italics.*
I read on Docutils that paragraphs are left-aligned. Apparently no indents. OK. 

**Two asterisks before and after a string is the emphasis of bold.**
The below guides go through the most important aspects of reStructuredText. For the authoritative reference, refer to the docutils documentation.

========================
More tips from Docutils:
========================
Subtitle: the most used formatting
----------------------------------
Titles are underlined (or over-and underlined) with a printing nonalphanumeric 7-bit ASCII character. 
OH! It doesn't HAVE to be the equal sign! There are many Recommended choices, which are: "``= - ` : ' " ~ ^ _ * + # < >``".
The underline/overline must be at least as long as the title text.

A lone top-level (sub)section is lifted up to be the document's (sub)title.
Ok, let's see if that works for the word "Subtitle" above. Didn't completely work...I'll have to research that. 

* This is a list item
* Here is a second list item
    * This is a sub-bullet
    * This is the second sub-bullet

This is a title (check)

Here is a paragraph.(check)

Here is another paragraph. You must include a blank line between paragraphs.(check)

* This is a list item
* Here is a second list item
    * This is a sub-bullet
    * This is the second sub-bullet

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BELOW ARE CONTENTS OF FILE NAMED YourName.rst
Look a Title
============

The above is a title. It could be formatted as something specifically labeled a title, or maybe just a heading level one. 

- I also need a list.
- This is a second list item.
- And look, a third list item.

#. Now I need an ordered list.
#. I can use this for procedures.
#. Or to identify items in an image I don't want to translate.

This is a `link to Google<http://www.google.com>`_.

The above should point to a map of where Spirit flies located in folder RoffoHW, week 7, under the Homework folder; same folder as this HW you are reading. Hmm, did not quite work; I see the word "image" in red font on line 75 of GitHub Desktop file; I'll have to research what little thing is out of order. I checked it with another classmate who used the same format, so I do not know; maybe images don't show on GitHub Desktop. Ok, it's 6:55 so I have to Submit and get to the Class zoom! 

The final item is a Table. Gee, I wish we could use Text Colors in ReST. Text could be so much easier to read if it could be separated by colors. Maybe in the Python/Sphinx option. 

+-------------------------+------------------------+
| Table Head 1            | Table Head Column 2    |
+=========================+========================+
| Column 1                | Column 2               |
+-------------------------+------------------------+
| More Column 1           | More Column 2          |
+-------------------------+------------------------+
| And a third row for fun | With one more column 2 |

I extended the columns and added a row, for practice with this table. 
WEEK 7 ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE!!! #

BELOW are other misc notes I copied from the files provided this week, in case they would be useful for the homework or other. So far I haven't needed them, but good resource info. Sphinx and other stuff. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~MCC documentation reST
.. mcc_reST documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Tue Mar  3 21:32:24 2020.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to mcc_reST's documentation!
