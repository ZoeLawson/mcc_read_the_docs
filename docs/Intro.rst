reStructuredText
=================

Yet another _lightweight_ markup language.[*]

Designed for documenting applications build using Python. 

If you work in a Python-based environment, installing Sphinx (the main tool that can process reStructuredText) is 
relatively simple.

If you're not familiar with playing with command-line things, installing Sphinx is not easy.

.. [*] Not to be confused with Yet Another Markup Language, also known as YAML.
